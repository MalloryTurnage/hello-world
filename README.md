Hello from the outside! 

The outside of the box that is!

I'm Mallory a.k.a. MalPal and I'm new to GitHub and software development. I'd like to think that I am not in "the box", but what defines "the box"? So subjective! Well anyway, I am a student at TrueCoders Coding Academy. I love art and designing or decorating just about anything! I enjoy designing succulent terrariums with all types of succulent plants and cacti and creating scenes with small figurines. I also enjoy drawing, making wood-burning art and digital photography. Creating is my passion and I've always loved to use my creativity to express my true authentic self. I also enjoy hearing and applying other's innovative ideas to my art or work. I want to be able to develop apps, websites or maybe even internet platforms that are not just user-friendly, but also aesthetically pleasing to the masses! I'm sure it's going to be a long coding journey, but I know I'm going to make it...with TrueCoders' help of course! Thanks for stopping by and remember this is only the beginning...To be Continued.
